About go-snomed
===============
This is a simple proof-of-concept project that will eventually turn into a terminology
server. It replaces an older java-based microservice [rsterminology](https://github.com/wardle/rsterminology) and is, 
as far as I know, the first Golang implementation of SNOMED-CT. 

At present it is still in development and is not ready for production use. It can import a SNOMED-CT distribution and has 
no runtime dependencies except a filesystem. Importantly, it will support read-only operation from a shared filesystem making
it ideal for use as a scalable microservice.
